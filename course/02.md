Day 02 - Reviewing the Basics of Git
====================================

Today, we'll be reviewing the basic flow of `git` and make our second commit.


## The Basic Flow of Git

The basic cycle of `git` in the development process looks as follows:

1. Make file changes
2. Stage those file changes
3. Commit file changes
4. Return to step 1

What can occasionally hang people up is **Step 2 - Staging Changes**. This isn't something that you see in all other Version Control Software systems.

To help understand, we need to understand how Git looks at files

## The Basics of the Git File Model

To start, read [2.2 Git Basics - Recording Changes to the Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository).

Git has four 'statuses' of files that it tracks (or doesn't track):

- Untracked
- Unmodified
- Modified
- Staged

Unmodified, Modified, and Staged files are all **tracked** files; Git knows about them and tracks their changes over time.

Additionally, there's another type of file that isn't talked about here: Untracked and Ignored. (We'll come back to this later).

Every file starts as **Untracked**. You saw this with our `README.md`. When we make _changes_ to files, `git` will pick that up.


## Changing our README

1. Open up your terminal and type in `vim README.md`.
2. Make some changes to the file!

Here are the changes I've made:

```
Example:

./diceroller.py 20 - Rolls a random 20 sided die
```

As a reminder, `i` to INSERT, `[ESC]` to return to NORMAL mode, `:wq` to write and exit.


## Checking git status

Previously, our `README.md` was in a **Tracked** and **Unmodified** state. Now, let's check `git status` to see what has happened.

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

If you've got colors enabled in your terminal, this line is likely in red:

```
modified:  README.md
```

Our `README.md` file is now in the **Tracked** and **Modified** stage. That means that there are changes to the file that have yet to be staged and ready to commit to the repository. So now, let's add it.


## Staging the file changes

Start by typing `git add README.md` into the terminal and hit `[ENTER]`. If you've done this right, you won't get any error output.

Now, let's check `git status` again:

```
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
```

If you have colors enabled, `modified:   README.md` will be highlighted in green. You'll also see the major difference:

`Changes not staged for commit:` vs `Changes to be commited:`.


## Commit our changes!

Finally, it's time to commit our changes: `git commit`

Once again you will be dropped into a text editor session. You'll see something like this:

```
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   README.md
#
~                               
~                               
~                               
~                               
```

You'll note that it repeats our `git status` window from before. However, there's a problem: we don't actually know _what_ changed. And I can tell you that I often forget the changes on individual files I'm making. I want to make sure that my commit message tells a good story.

So!

For now, back out of the commit by doing `:q!`, which will quit without saving.

If you've done this properly, you'll see the following:

```
Aborting commit due to empty commit message.
```

So now we're going to modify our `git` command: `git commit -v`

Upon entering `vim`, we'll see a change to our output:

```

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   README.md
#
# ------------------------ >8 ------------------------
# Do not modify or remove the line above.
# Everything below it will be ignored.

```

A whole lot more!

What we've done by adding the `-v` switch is to add the **unified diff** to the commit window. This lets us review our changes while we're making our commit. Learning how to read `git` diff messages will be its own separate topic, but for right now, here are some of the basics:

- Lines that start with a blank character are unchanged.
- Lines that start with a `+` are lines that are added
- Lines that start with a `-` are lines that are removed

In general, `git` works based on lines, particularly with respect to diffs. (This is something that we'll revisit as we go along).

With this added context in the commit window, we can now write a better commit message.


### Brief Aside - Good Quality Commit Messages

Start practicing good habits _now_ when it comes to commit messages. It'll pay dividends down the road.

Read through this reference: [A Note ABout Git commit Messages - Tim Pope](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

Here's a terse summary of Tim Pope's points:

- Have a Subject line (summary, captialized, 50 chars or less)
- Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug", not "Fixed" or "Fixes"
- Add additional explanatory text afterwards.
- If you're going to use bullets (which are totally fine to do), use a hanging indent

The Subject/Summary line is critical because, as Tim Pope notes, it shows up in a number of different places.

We'll talk more about the _content_ of a `git` commit message later, but for now, it's enough to know the format and style.


### An example commit message

Here's what I used for my commit message:

```
Add CLI example to README.md
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   README.md
#
# ------------------------ >8 ------------------------
# Do not modify or remove the line above.
# Everything below it will be ignored.

I type `:wq` to write my message, which then gives me this output. (Yours will look slightly different!)

```
[master 53728a7] Add CLI example to README.md
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
```

Now, if I check `git status`, I'll see the following:

```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## One last command - git log

Here's our last command of the day: `git log`

Typing this in will get you something like the following:

`git log` will show you a log of your `git` history! There are a bunch of different options for controling output... and we'll get to that on another day! For now, it's enough to know that it's there. If you want to check out some options, check out `tldr git-log` or `man git log`.
